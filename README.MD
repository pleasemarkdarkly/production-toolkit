## Annoying Litigation Production Tool

An attorney was bullying a friend of mine who was representing himself in Court. So he asked if I would help him process the PDFs he was to provide to the opposing party in response to a subpoena. These scripts was this effort. It takes the PDFs and converts them to images then rotates, watermarks, and compresses them within the King County Superior Court rules and the Federal Rules of Civile Procedure. 

The image size is huge. The rotation is to cause additional delay printing or processing the file, as the printing would have to rotate back, watermarking is a ensure the senstive information does not get distributed, and the encryption on a per file level makes it pertty tedious to access the files. Of course each PDF page is a single image.
